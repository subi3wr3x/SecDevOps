#### Pi 3 B+ Config for use as a Network Tap 

#### Usage
Add a USB Ethernet Adapter to the pi and setup the pi w/the included configs

#### Expectations
The PI will sit between your Cable Modem and Wireless Router using a Linux Ethernet Bridge.
You want both Ethernet ports to have no IP, but have the PI be accessible via ssh through the local wireless AP for admin access with ssh.
